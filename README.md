### Catalog Course Description

> This course is a study of the general linear statistical model. Topics include the theory of linear models, distributions of quadratic forms, full rank linear models, estimation under linear constraints and hypothesis testing for the full rank linear models, and ﬁxed eﬀect models of less than full rank, and other related models.

### Student Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing data using linear regression, ANOVA, mixed-effect models, and other related methods.  This will include cleaning and visualization of the data, choosing an appropriate model design, diagnosing model performance, and preparing summary plots and a written report interpreting the results of the analysis.

### Course Evaluation and Grading

#### Assessments

- 4 Homework Assignments **(50%)**
- 1 Midterm Exam **(20%)**
- 1 (Final Exam) **(30%)**

##### Homework Assignments

- Homework assignments consist of a combination of theory and application problems based on the lecture and book material, and involve, e.g., coding, mathematical derivations, and interpreting model results.
- Due date will typically be 1 - 2 weeks after it is assigned.
- Late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval.
- Your submitted assignments should be organized, with the assignment number, your name, and the date all clearly visible on the first page. 
- Any results, derivations, or any other form of work you include that is not your own must be cited with a full reference.
- I **strongly** prefer you type your assignments using $\LaTeX$ or Markdown.
- Homework submission will occur online.  See the course webpage for further instructions.

##### Midterm Exam

- In-class, closed book, one page of notes (standard letter paper, front and back).
- Questions similar to homework assignments.
- Specific material covered and further details on the exam will be provided in class.

##### Final Exam

- In-class, closed book, two pages of notes (standard letter paper, front and back each page).
- Covers material from entire course, with an emphasis on material covered since the midterm exam.
- Further details will be provided in class.

#### Grading Scale

A-F Grading Scale:

A: >= 90% & <= 100% 

B: >= 80% & < 90%

### Policies & Guidelines

Students are required to follow and be aware of the Augusta University Student Attendance Policy, which states 

>regular, punctual attendance is expected of students in all courses at Augusta University and is counted at >the first class meeting each term. Faculty members are required to monitor student attendance and ongoing >participation in the course.  Additional attendance requirements may be established by the individual schools >or programs as well as by the individual faculty member in each course.  Students who incur an excessive >number of absences, as defined by the faculty member and/or college, may be subject to academic penalty.

The full Student Attendance policy can be found in the AU Policy Library at https://www.augusta.edu/compliance/policyinfo/policies.php, 
and from the Graduate School at https://www.augusta.edu/gradschool/student-resources.php.

#### Course Attendance Policy

- Please inform me in advance, either in person or by email, if you anticipate being absent.
- In case of emergency that prevents contacting me prior to the class meeting, inform me as soon as you can.
- If you anticipate consecutive absences or an extended period of absence, contact me to discuss arrangments.
- Being absent does not permit you to turn in an assignment late.
- Frequent absenteeism will be frowned upon :(
